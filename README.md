# fortran-sorting
Implemented various sorting techniques in old Fortran.
We utilized a recursive and an iterative version of quicksort to time which executed faster. In this case, my results found the recursive was slightly faster than the iterative function, although they were both under .1 seconds.

# "iqsort.f03" file:
- This was adapted from the code given in the assignment of a Pascal implementation of quicksort

# "stackADT.f03" file:
- This is utilized to create a stack data structure and the commands that control it, including push, pop, isEmpty, clear and printStack.

# "intIO.f03" file:
- This program is utilized for reading and writing data. It prompts the user for a file name, calculates the size, allocates the memory for the array, and reads the data into that array.

# "rqSort.f03" file:
- This program utilizes a recursive quicksort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
